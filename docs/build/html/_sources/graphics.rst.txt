Graphics
====================================================

The graphics you're using would really depend on what you're making the graphics for, but here are some suggested guidelines.

1. **Action shots are nice for impact**

2. **Not pixelated**

3. **In focus**

If we don't have good photos available, just put a ton of filters on them so the details can't be seen and throw a bunch of text or other info on top.

One way to do it would be: Desaturate + Low Contrast + Darken + optional colour overlay. Getting rid of a distracting background can help too. Some early samples:

.. image:: assets/images/graphics-example-1.jpg
   :height: 500px


.. image:: assets/images/graphics-example-2.png
   :height: 500px

At the moment, we don't have much to work with, so maybe this will develop further as we go.
