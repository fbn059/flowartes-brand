Language & Copywriting
==================================

As per what Contramestre has mentioned in the Whatsapp group:

  *Hi guys, as for the description on the activities, the aim is to show the full capacity of Capoeira as a martial art. I don’t want people to see Capoeira as a dance anymore. And for the movement classes, we will emphasise on the flow that is present in Capoeira. As for Maculelê, the emphasis is on the intensity of the class, similar to cardio. Obrigado*

So I guess the main keywords would be something like these:

Fitness, high-intensity, flow, martial art, combat, Brazilian culture, movement, Capoeira, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu/BJJ, HIIT, music, Maculelê

**Movement, not dance. Absolutely nothing on dAnCiNg. NOTHINGGG**

I'm not sure how you guys want to set the tone for the copywriting and general brand personality though.

I'm no copywriter, so if anyone has expertise on this and can add to this section, let me know!
