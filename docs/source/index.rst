FlowArtes Brand Identity
====================================================

Hey guys, this is a really quick brand guide for any FlowArtes materials you would like to produce. This document contains guides for:

* What colours to use

* How to use the various versions of the logo

* What kind of graphics and photos to use in any publicity materials

No absolute rules here, but please try to keep these guides in mind when making any FlowArtes stuff.

For corrections / suggestions / additions, let me know! You can also comment on the |github-repo| if you like.

Much thanks, |br|
- Fa√≠sca
